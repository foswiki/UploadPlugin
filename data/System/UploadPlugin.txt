%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin provides a more flexible interface to upload one or more files
to a topic. Using standard means, only one file can be uploaded at the same
time. In comparison this plugin allows to upload multiple files with one
transaction and optionally using an asynchronous request.

---++ Syntax
<verbatim>%UPLOADFORM{
  ajax="on|off"
  comment="on|off"
  target="on|off"
  multiple="on|off"
  embed="on|off"
}%</verbatim>

The =comment=, =target=, =multiple=  and =embed= parameters toggle different features
of the upload form:

   * =ajax= - switch on/off asynchronous operation mode; defaults to off
   * =comment= - switch on/off the comment field for uploads
   * =target= - switch on/off the target field; defaults to current topic
   * =multiple= - switch on/off multi-file upload
   * =embed= - switching this to =on= will omit the outer form markup; that's useful
     to _embed_ the upload form into a larger form, that the upload is part of
   * =onsuccess= - function to be called after a sucessful upload; aditionally, the javascript event =sucess.uploader= is fired on success
   * =onerror= - function to be called after a failed upload; the javascript event =error.uploader= is fired when an error occurs
